# Donut Run

karx's entry for PyWeek 31. Tested on Python 3.8.1 in a normal python
virtual environment on Arch Linux.

## Running

First, you must install the required libraries.
You can do this by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, simply run the `main.py` file.

```bash
python main.py
```

## Controls

Use WASD/Arrow Keys to move around the map. Use your mouse to aim at enemies.

When all the enemies are killed, the game will advance to the next wave.
